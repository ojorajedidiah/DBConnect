# DBConnect
Databas connection class (written in PHP) to facilitate connecting to any Structured Database using the PDO object. 

Over the years, I have worked on several projects and majorily we need to maintain presistent data for both operational and referential purposes. Therefore, it is important to standardise the connect to all structured database. Migrating from closed-source database engines (SQL Server) to the open-source database engines (MySQL) it was an experience worth documenting.

What i have done here is to create a single class to effectively management connection only. I delibrately left out standard database operations like INSERTs, SELECTs, UPDATEs and DELETEs because lots of classes exist online that provides these operations.

Enjoy the class and i will appreciate any feedback or contribution to the code.
